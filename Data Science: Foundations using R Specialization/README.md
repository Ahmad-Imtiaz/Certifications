# About this Specialization

Ask the right questions, manipulate data sets, and create visualizations to communicate results.
This Specialization covers foundational data science tools and techniques, including getting, cleaning, and exploring data, programming in R, and conducting reproducible research. Learners who complete this specialization will be prepared to take the Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning specialization, in which they build a data product using real-world data.

The five courses in this specialization are the very same courses that make up the first half of the Data Science Specialization. This specialization is presented for learners who want to start and complete the foundational part of the curriculum first, before moving onto the more advanced topics in Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning.

# Applied Learning Project
In taking the Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization, learners will complete a project at the ending of each course in this specialization. Projects include, installing tools, programming in R, cleaning data, performing analyses, as well as peer review assignments.

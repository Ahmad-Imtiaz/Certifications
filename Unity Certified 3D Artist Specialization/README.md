# About this Specialization

This is Unityâ€™s official series of courses designed to prepare you for the Unity Certified 3D Artist exam, the certification for entry- to mid-level 3D artists who work with the Unity platform. This series of courses is for 3D Artists who have used Unity for real-time rendering for 1-2 years, and are ready to bring their existing skills up to a professional standard.

# Applied Learning Project
Learners in this Specialization will complete multiple project milestones across 2 main projects: a Kitchen Configuration application with a realistic aesthetic, and a 3D video game level with a more stylized science-fantasy look. Across these 2 projects, learners will complete tasks including importing assets, manipulating materials, creating prefabs, adding lighting, setting up character models, and building cutscenes.

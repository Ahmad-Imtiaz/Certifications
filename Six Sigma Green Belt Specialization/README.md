# About this Specialization

This specialization is for you if you are looking to learn more about the more advanced components of Six Sigma and Lean. Six Sigma skills are widely sought by employers both nationally and internationally. These skills have been proven to help improve business processes, performance, and quality assurance.

In this specialization, you will learn proven principles and tools specific to six sigma and lean.

This is a sequential, linear designed specialization that covers a more advanced level of content (at the "green belt" level) of Six Sigma and Lean. Yellow Belt knowledge is needed before advancing to Green Belt (which is the second specialization offered here on Coursera by the USG). Green Belt knowledge is needed before moving to a Black Belt.

The proper sequence of this specialization is:

Course #1 - Six Sigma and the Organization (Advanced)

Course #2 - Six Sigma Advanced Define and Measure Phase

Course #3 - Six Sigma Advanced Analyze Phase

Course #4 - Six Sigma Advanced Improve and Control Phase

At the end of Course #4 (Six Sigma Advanced Improve and Control Phase), there is a peer-reviewed, capstone project. Successful completion of this project is necessary for full completion of this specialization.

It should be noted that completing either the Yellow Belt or Green Belt Specializations does not give the learner "professional accreditation" in Six Sigma, but should assist in better preparation for such professional accreditation testing.

# Applied Learning Project
Upon completion of this specialization, learners will have created a project charter, project team charter, data collection plan, process map, control plan, along with null and alternative hypotheses, problem statement, business case, goal statement, process and scope description, and timeline. All these will be created using the six sigma principles and tools they learned.
